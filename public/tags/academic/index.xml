      <description>While developing my restaurant mapping project, Madison eats, I came across an interesting problem. I intended to use the API from a popular restaurant review website to populate my application, but like many public API&amp;rsquo;s there were reasonable limits in place. Given an exact location and radius, the api would return a maximum of 50 restaurants per call with 5,000 calls allowed per day. With these constraints, what is the best method to get the data for all restaurants in a region.</description>
